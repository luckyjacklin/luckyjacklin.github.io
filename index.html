  	<h1>About Glide</h1>

    <img src="images/glide_logo.png" width="600px" alt="Glide image">

    <p>Glide is a fast and efficient image loading library for Android focused on smooth scrolling. Glide offers an easy to use API, a performant and extensible resource decoding pipeline and automatic resource pooling.</p>

    <h3>Performance</h3>

    <p>Glide takes a number of steps to ensure image loading is both as fast and as smooth as possible on Android:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>Smart and automatic downsampling and caching minimize storage overhead and decode times.</li>
    	<li>Aggressive re-use of resources like byte arrays and Bitmaps minimizes expensive garbage collections and heap fragmentation.</li>
    	<li>Deep lifecycle integration ensures that only requests for active Fragments and Activities are prioritized and that Applications release resources when necessary to avoid being killed when backgrounded.</li>
    </ul>
